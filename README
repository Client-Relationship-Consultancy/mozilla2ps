Code: https://bitbucket.org/mbaldessari/mozilla2ps

* Usage and configuration

Make sure you have Xulrunner correctly installed.

xulrunner --install-app mozilla2ps-0.8.xulapp /tmp
xulrunner /tmp/mozilla2ps/application.ini file:///tmp/foo.html /tmp/foo.ps
xulrunner /tmp/mozilla2ps/application.ini --pdf=true http://www.lwn.net /tmp/lwn.pdf

* Running on Windows

In order to get mozilla2ps to work on windows you'll need to install
a suitable postscript printer. Download the "winsteng.exe" from Adobe
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=44&platform=Windows
install and configure a printer called "Generic PostScript Printer" that prints
to a FILE: port.
At this point mozill2ps should work normally on windows as well with no 
changes.

* Font spacing problems
If the font spacing of your printed output is bad, you need to tweak fontconfig
to disable autohinting. This is a well-known problem with XUL:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=490475

The best solution is to tweak fonts.conf and set the autohinting to none:
 <match target="font" >
  <edit mode="assign" name="hintstyle" >
   <const>hintnone</const>
  </edit>
 </match>

If chaning the system wide defaults (/etc/fonts/*) is no acceptable, it is possible
to change the .fonts.conf of the user running the script
